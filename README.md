## Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: Pure HTML5 Canvas + JavaScript (no external libraries)
- **Backend**: FastAPI + SQLModel
- **Database**: SQLite
- **Styling**: Pure CSS with modern gradients and animations

## Quick Start

1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install fastapi uvicorn sqlmodel
   ```

2. **Run the server**:
   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

3. **Open the game**:
   - Main game: `http://localhost:8000/`
   - Leaderboard: `http://localhost:8000/leaderboard`
   - API: `http://localhost:8000/api/leaderboard`
